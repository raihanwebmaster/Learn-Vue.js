## What is Vue.js?

A popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

```
The core Vue library is focused on doing one thing and doing that one thing really well: building user interfaces.
Vue does not focus on other aspects of your application like routing or HTTP requests.
Vue has a rich ecosystem of other powerful libraries that you can integrate.
- Vuex: npm package for complex state management.
- Vue Router: for routing.
- Vuetify: for UI elements and a lot more.
```

## Vue File Structure

```
A *.vue file is a custom file format that uses HTML-like syntax to describe a portion of the UI.
Each *.vue file consists of three types of top-level language blocks:
- <template></template>: The HTML of your UI.
- <script></script>: The logic and functionality of your app.
- <style></style>: The CSS styles related to the markup in the template block.
```
